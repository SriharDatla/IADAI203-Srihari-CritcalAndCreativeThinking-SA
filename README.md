# RemoteVibe: Digital Nomad Community App

## 1. Project Overview
**RemoteVibe** is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between productivity and lifestyle for digital nomads. It solves the dual challenges of **isolation** and **logistical complexity** (visas, taxes) in a single platform.

## 2. Target Audience
* **Alex (Freelancer):** Needs quiet workspaces and reliable internet.
* **Priya (Marketer):** Needs safety and community events.
* **Mateo (Developer):** Needs budget-friendly options and offline tools.

## 3. Key Features
### Mandatory Features (from Brief)
* **Virtual Coworking:** Live "Deep Work" sprints with accountability partners.
* **Café Finder:** Map with verified Wi-Fi speeds and power outlet filters.
* **Wellness Integration:** Posture reminders and local gym finder.

### Unique Features ( Innovation)
* **Nomad Visa Tracker:** Automated countdowns and exit alerts based on GPS location.
* **Skill Swap Market:** Barter system for trading skills (e.g., Coding for Spanish lessons).
* **Offline Emergency Mode:** One-tap access to embassy details without data.

## 4. Design Process & Tools
* **Tools Used:** Miro (Wireframing & Storyboard), Figma (High-Fidelity Assets).
* **Ideation:** Used **SCAMPER** to evolve features (e.g., "Substituting" text reviews for video proof).
* **Systematic Design:** Used **Morphological Analysis** to combine logistics and safety features.

## 5. Usability Testing & Refinements
* **Issue:** Users struggled to identify "Verified" cafes.
    * **Fix:** Added a green "Verified" badge to list items.
* **Issue:** "Visa Tracker" was hidden in settings.
    * **Fix:** Moved tracker to the Home Screen as a primary widget.
